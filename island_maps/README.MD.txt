## Pick A Flower
The Jeroo starts at position (2, 2), facing East, and the goal is to reach and pick the flower at (3, 3).

## Avoid the Net
The Jeroo starts at (2, 2) and needs to avoid the water at (2, 3) and reach the flower at (2, 4).

## Plant Flowers in a Line
The Jeroo starts at (2, 2), and its goal is to plant flowers as it moves East.

## Navigate Water and Nets
The Jeroo starts at (2, 2) and must avoid both water and nets. There is a flower at (4, 1) that it must reach. The Jeroo must hop carefully to avoid obstacles.

## Multiple Jeroos, Multiple Goals
Two Jeroos are in the game, one at (1, 2) and the other at (6, 3). They both need to collect different flowers scattered across the island. The goal is for each Jeroo to pick up the flowers without interfering with each other.

## Pathfinding with Obstacles
The Jeroo starts at (2, 2). It has to navigate through water (w) and avoid nets in order to reach a flower at (4, 4). The challenge here is that the Jeroo will have to use turn() and hop() effectively to maneuver through the map.

## Collecting Multiple Flowers
The Jeroo starts at (4, 3). It needs to collect 3 flowers and avoid water, all while navigating a more complex path. There is water at (1, 1), and the flowers are located at (2, 2), (4, 5), and (5, 2).

## Turn And Avoid Water
The Jeroo starts at (2, 3) and has to turn left and avoid water at (1, 1) and (3, 1). There's a flower at (8, 4) that the Jeroo must pick up. The challenge is more about turning in the right direction to avoid the water and find the flower.
